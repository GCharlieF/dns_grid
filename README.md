============
Code for direct numerical simulations of Navier-Stokes equations in triperiodic domain with pseudo-spectral discretization

Required Libraries
-------------------------------
FFTW

OPENMPI

P3DFFT


Is better if all libraries are compiled with the same compiler and Include and Lib paths are given directly in the makefile
